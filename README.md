# Thinkful Project - GrubDash
#### A project as part of Thinkful Engineering Immersion.  

The assignment for this project is to build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.  The "database" the server is connected to is a local file, as we had not yet learned
how to utilize a PostgreSQL database.  Nonetheless, this server is able to handle various CRUD requests.  Additionally, this for this project, we were required to write
numerous validation functions for most CRUD requests, so this assignment demonstrates our ability to create and implement those validation functions.
